Calculator
==========

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/kvirund/calculator](https://badges.gitter.im/kvirund/calculator.svg)](https://gitter.im/kvirund/calculator?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Calculator which has been written on C++ using re2c and lemon. Currently implemented simple operation on four different types:

  1. integer
  2. float
  3. boolean
  4. string
    
Also calculator makes possible to use variables. One predefined constant is 'pi'

At this time implemented following operations:

  1. add (+)
  2. sub (-)
  3. division (/)
  4. mod (%)
  5. times (*)
  6. All relationship operations (<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=)
  7. Negative (-)
  8. logical AND, OR and NOT
  9. Assignment ([variable name]=[variable value])

Requirements
============

For building project usually you need only cmake. But if you want to regenerate scanner and syntax analyzer, you should have re2c and lemon utilities accordingly.
    
Building
========

Just type following commands from root of project directory:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

To perform tests, from build directory run test/test.it.pl:

    $ ../test/test.it.pl

You must see something like:

    $ ../test/test.it.pl

    (Expressions parser) Sum test                                          [PASSED]
    (WHERE parser) Escape string                                           [PASSED]
